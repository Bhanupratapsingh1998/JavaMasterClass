public class A {

}

public class B extends A {

}

public interface C {
    A add();
}

public class D implements C {

    @Override
    public B add() { 
        return null; // Valid, as B is a subclass of A (covariant return type).
    }
}


Overriding Rules:

In Java, when a class implements an interface or overrides a method, the method signature (method name, return type, and parameters) must exactly match or be covariant.
A covariant return type means the return type of the overriding method can be a subclass of the return type of the overridden method.
